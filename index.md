# EE 227C<br /> Convex Optimization and Approximation

University of California, Berkeley  
Spring 2018 

Time: TuTh 12:30PM - 1:59PM  
Location:	Etcheverry 3106  
Instructor: [Moritz Hardt](http://mrtz.org) (Email: hardt+ee227c@berk...edu)   
Graduate Instructor: [Max Simchowitz](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~msimchow/index.html) (Email: msimchow@berk...edu)

## Updates

* *The class and its waitlist are completely full.* Please check back later in the
semester to see if enrollment will have become availability. Visitors are
permitted to audit only if there is enough space in the room. Please do leave
available seats to enrolled students.


## Assingments 

Assignments will be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/ee227c/home). If you haven't already, [sign up here](piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/ee227c). Homeworks will be assigned ~every two weeks, and 2-3 problems will be selected for grading (we will not tell you which ones in advance). Assignments should be submitted through [GradeScope](https://gradescope.com); the course is listed as EE227C, which you may join with entry code 9P5NDV. Students will be permitted two unexcused late assignments (up to a week late). Students requesting additional extensions should email Max.

## Grading

Grading policy: 50% homeworks, 10% scribing, 20% midterm exam, 20% final exam. 

## Course notes

Course notes will be available to participants. Participants will
collaboratively create and maintain notes over the course of the semester
using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/berkeley).
Berkeley students get a free pro account.

## Summary

This course will explore theory and algorithms for nonlinear optimization. We
will focus on problems that arise in machine learning and computational
statistics, paying close attention to concerns about complexity, robustness, and
implementation in these domains. Whenever possible, methods will be linked to
particular application examples in data analysis.

## Topics

Convexity

Ellipsoid algorithm

Gradient method for smooth convex functions

Gradient method for Lipschitz (non-smooth) convex functions

Strongly convex problems

Stochastic optimization

Momentum and acceleration: The quadratic case

Acceleration: General case

Lower bounds for first-order optimization

Trade-offs between robustness and acceleration

Mildly non-convex problems

Backpropagation

Subgradients

Proximal methods

Coordinate descent methods

Primal-dual decomposition

## Background

The prerequisites are previous coursework in linear algebra, multivariate
calculus, probability and statistics. 
Coursework or background in optimization theory as covered in
EE227BT is highly recommended.  The class will involve some basic programming.
Students are encouraged to use either [Julia](https://julialang.org) or Python.
We discourage the use of MATLAB.
